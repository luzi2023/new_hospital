The advanced reconstruction procedures I do in my oncology practice are similar in nature to revision joint arthroplasty. As an adjunct to my oncology practice I also perform primary total knee and total hip replacements and complex total joint revision surgery.  Many patients with metabolic bone disorders need arthroplasty surgery at some point, and due to their bone quality often require special consideration and alternative reconstructive surgeries in order for them to re-gain maximal function with minimal complications.I find surgical oncology and joint revision surgery a challenging but invigorating field. Each operation is different, as no two patients or their reconstructive challenges are alike. I have the opportunity to treat patients of all ages and to operate on different areas of the anatomy. Most important, I am able to make a true difference in my patients' lives by helping them overcome their disease, while maintaining mobility and function.Cancer patients require a multidisciplinary approach to care.
