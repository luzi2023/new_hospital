D00548,Orthopaedic Surgery,"As an orthopaedic oncologist, I specialize in treating both benign and malignant musculoskeletal tumors in adults and children. I have a particular interest in limb-sparing surgery and endoprosthetic reconstruction for treating bone sarcomas. The advanced reconstruction procedures I do in my oncology practice are similar in nature to revision joint arthroplasty. As an adjunct to my oncology practice I also perform primary total knee and total hip replacements and complex total joint revision surgery.  Many patients with metabolic bone disorders need arthroplasty surgery at some point, and due to their bone quality often require special consideration and alternative reconstructive surgeries in order for them to re-gain maximal function with minimal complications.I find surgical oncology and joint revision surgery a challenging but invigorating field. Each operation is different, as no two patients or their reconstructive challenges are alike. I have the opportunity to treat patients of all ages and to operate on different areas of the anatomy. Most important, I am able to make a true difference in my patients' lives by helping them overcome their disease, while maintaining mobility and function.Cancer patients require a multidisciplinary approach to care. I treat each patient with compassion and understanding ??and try my best to involve patients and their families in the decision-making process, as much as possible. Along with medicine, I believe strongly in yoga, meditation, and reiki as ways to complement our medical treatment of our patients.

Since I believe the best approach to care is a collaborative partnership that takes individual patient needs into account, I work together with my patients to help achieve the best outcome to speed recovery and maximize overall health. I bring to the table my skills, experience and education, but my patients bring a deep understanding of their own bodies that no one else can match. As my patient, you can be confident knowing I am here to listen ??and to partner with you to deliver the best possible custom-tailored care.Conditions I Treat- Colon cancer/polyps- Rectal cancer- Anal cancer - Appendiceal cancer-Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis)-Diverticulitis"
